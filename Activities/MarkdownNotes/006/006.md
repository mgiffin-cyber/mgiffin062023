# The Mole Notes

### Mole = "Lump"

##### *The mole provides a bridge that allows us to compare numbers of particles by measuring mass or gaseous volume (see “map” below)*

*By finding instances in nature where two amounts of different elements have equal numbers of atoms, early chemists were able to find the relative masses of the atoms of each element.*

*Relative masses can be used to compare the number of particles in samples of substances.*

**The atomic mass units on the periodic table are the number of grams per mole (g/mol)! 
This is also called MOLAR MASS.**
