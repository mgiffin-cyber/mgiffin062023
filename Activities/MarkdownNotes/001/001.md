![Proper Measurement](Images/propermeasurement.png "Proper Measurement")

A **proper measurement** has exactly _one_ estimated digit and includes the correct units.

The amount of _uncertainty_ in a measurement depends on which place holder the estimated digit is in.

**Percision**: the amount of uncertainty in a measurement

**Accuracy**: how close a measurement is to the true value.
**Remember**:

- starts at zero
- marks are properly placed
- always use the classes data, not your own

![Correct Units](Images/correctunits.png "Correct Units")

When measuring, **ALWAYS** remember to use the correct units because if you don't it could throw everything off.
