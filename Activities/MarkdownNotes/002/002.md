**Definition**: All the numbers in a measure that represent a certian or uncertain digit.

**Remember**:

- placeholders do not count as significant digits
- non-sigfigs will disappear in scientific notation
- the coefficient is the only thing counted as significant

### We do scientific notation to get rid of the placeholders!
